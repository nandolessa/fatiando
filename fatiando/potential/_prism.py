    Calculates the :math:`g_{zz}` gravity gradient tensor component.

    .. note:: The coordinate system of the input parameters is to be x -> North,
        y -> East and z -> **DOWN**.

    .. note:: All input values in **SI** units(!) and output in **mGal**!

    Parameters:
    
    * xp, yp, zp : arrays
        Arrays with the x, y, and z coordinates of the computation points.
    * prisms : list of :class:`~fatiando.mesher.ddd.Prism`
        The density model used to calculate the gravitational effect.
        Prisms must have the property ``'density'``. Prisms that don't have this
        property will be ignored in the computations. Elements of *prisms* that
        are None will also be ignored. *prisms* can also be a
